Nearest Regularized Subspace (NRS) Classifier
=============================================

Introduction
------------

The NRS classifier is a supervised classification
technique first proposed in

> W. Li, E. W. Tramel, S. Prasad, and J. E. Fowler,
>"Nearest Regularized Subspace for Hyperspectral Classification,"
>IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 
>accepted October, 2010.

This code is shared as a living work. It is our
intent to add functionality, fix bugs, and address
any other potential concerns through this repository.

Additionally, it is our hope that this repository
will serve to promote reproducibility in research. 
If you're researching the topic, please feel free
to fork us and build up new functionality!

Langauges
---------
The NRS classifier is currently implemented in Matlab.
This choice of language is more an artifact of our research
work-flow than of any particular desire to choose Matlab
over any other implementation. While Matlab is easy for us,
many do not have access to this piece of proprietary software.

Future plans include ports to other familiar script-style
languages, such as Octave and Python, to allow for free and
open use of this software. If you have a desire or inclination
to port this code to your favorite language, please submit a 
pull request and we'll build up a ports section
